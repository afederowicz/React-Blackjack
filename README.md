# React BlackJack #
#### A BlackJack card game built with React.js and Redux. We implemented unit testing with Mocha, Chai, & Enzyme. A user must sign up to play. Upon successful login, user session is maintained using Passport.js. User authentication for user login/sign-up is also implemented using Passport. User login credentials & game information are stored in MongoDB database, using Passport as middleware.
