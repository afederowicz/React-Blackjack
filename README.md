# React BlackJack #
#### A BlackJack card game built with React.js and Redux. We set up unit testing using Mocha, Chai, & Enzyme. A user must sign up to enter the blackjack room. When a user signs up, the user's credentials are securely stored in the MongoDB database with password encryption. User authentication is set up to ensure successful login for each user session, which is maintained with Passport. The blackjack player's record is established after playing, and is saved in the database as well.
